    Calling the file called base, importing, pasting that file in here.
    So we are making references to other partials by working with the use parameter and 
    then typing it in the name of the file that we want to import, e.g. variables
    Notice that we don't need to write the underscore (this is just for the parser so it knows 
    its a file and not to cnvert to other css file) and the extension at the end.
    This file will be auto converted into style.css file when SASS outputs the final files, but other file
    with the underscore at the start of their file name will NOT be generated as separate .css files.
