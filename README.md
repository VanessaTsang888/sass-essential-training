# SASS Essential Training

[SASS Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sass-essential-training-15630917?replacementOf=sass-essential-training-2015)

I am using a SASS training course on LinkedIn Learning to learn the fundamentals of the Synatically Awesome Stylesheets (SaSS) a modern web development language that helps us write CSS better, faster and with more advanced features. The instructor shows us the best way to install SaSS and work with its main features: variables, nesting, partilas and mixins. Plus learn how to use SassScript to create complex functions from Sass lists and control statements.

Duration: 1h 19m | Beginner | Released: 3/3/2022.

## Why This Course?

I am studying this online training course as once I have completed the course my SASS skills will enable to me to complete certain projects in software engineering at a more efficient manner. This skill will enhance my day to day job as a Frontend Software Engineer.

SASS is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself. It is completely compatible with all versions of CSS.
SASS is the most popular CSS preprocessor. It is a great language to manage our stylesheets differently and better. With this programming language I can use modules, nesting, conditions, loops etc. I can use it's core functionalities like color manipulation.

We write the scss syntax rather than css syntax as it is more effient and more powerful. It is also css friendly meaning I can past my css code into my scss code files and then do some editing and this code will be valid scss code.

## How?

In conjuntion with this training courses I am also using the [SASS official documentations](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) from the [SASS official website](https://sass-lang.com/) 

I am not only taking notes using VS Code IDE -> markdown files but also coding with the instructor. Also, my comments within my code file are notes to demonstate my learning. In real life - project work, this is NOT how I would write my code comments as this is for training purposes ONLY. For project work, my code comments will be to briefly explain what a block of code is doing, rather than the concept of the SASS feature I am using.


### Resources
	
Whilst I am working through this training course I am using the [SASS Official Docs](https://sass-lang.com/) as I found out that the course sometimes is not detailed enough for me. I am finding the SASS Official Docs very usefull and going forward I will be using this very important rescource in my day to day job / project work.

All my code I write during this course is safely pushed and stored in my [GitHub](https://github.com/VanessaTsang888/sass-essential-training)
I will be looking for someone to do my code review before I merge from the dev to main branch. I have also push a couple of screen shots to evidence that I have successfully completed the Quiz for each of the two sections within the course.

### My Feedback

I have been working on this SASS training course around my project work and I found this learning to be rewarding and valuable for my job as a Frontend Software Engineer. Going forward I will be using the [SASS Official Docs](https://sass-lang.com/) during my day to day job - project work as I've found this a very valueable resource during this course.
