[SASS Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sass-essential-training-15630917/sass-syntax?autoplay=true&u=93622354)

I am using a SASS course on LinkedIn Learning to learn the fundamentals of Synatically Awesome Stylesheets (Sass) a modern web development language that helps you write CSS better, faster and with more advanced features. The instructor shows us the best way to install Sass and work with its main features: variables, nesting, partilas and minins. Plus learn how to use SassScript to create complex functions from Sass lists and control statements.

Duration: 1h 19m | Beginner | Released: 3/3/2022.

## Why This Course?

I am studying this online training course as once I have completed the course the SASS skills will enable to me to complete certain projects in software engineering at a more efficient manner.

SASS is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets. SassScript is the scripting language itself. It is completely compatible with all versions of css.
SASS is the most popular CSS preprocessor. It is a great language to manage our stylesheets differently and better. With this programming language we can use modules, nesting, conditions, loops etc. We can use it's core functionalities like color manipulation.

We write the scss syntax rather than css as it is more effient and more powerful than css. It is also css friendly meaning you can past css code into your scss code files and then do some editing.

## How?

I am not only taking notes using VS Code IDE but also coding with the instructor. My notes files are located in the directory named: notes-sass-funamentals

In conjuntion with this training courses I am also using the [SASS official documentations](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/) from the [SASS official website](https://sass-lang.com/)
