/* 

This is the scss code complied to css code. 
This css code is a lot longer (repeating code) compared to scss code which makes it not as efficient as writing scss code. 
This go against the DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself) principle which is best practice in software engineering. However, browsers 
can't work or complie scss code. This is why we are using SASS language to write scss code or syntax.
