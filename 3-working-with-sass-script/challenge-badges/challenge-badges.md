# Challenge Badges

The challenge is to create a mixin that will help us generate badges for a website.

## The Problem
[The Problem](http://raybo.org/slides_sassesst/?d=03_10&#/0/0/3)
Use the following SASS features or concepts to create the badges:

- maps
Use maps to create a set of color options for the badges.

- hover color
Use a hover color that uses SASS color functions.

- conditionals
Use conditionals that allow for a version of the bedges that is more rounded. We'll call these pills.

- each at-rule
Use the each statement to navigate through the maps and create the badge styles.

### The Starter Code

1. HTML: heading 1, paragraph, and three button elements. The span elements contain class attributes which we use in our scss code to define our styles for our button in an efficient manner.
2. SASS: The badge class with basic styles defined.

## The Solution
