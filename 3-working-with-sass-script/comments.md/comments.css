COMMENTS 

This is the compiled into css. You can see all the different types of comments show up but the Javascript comment.
    // JavaScript Style -- Unpublished

If we output things in compressed mode, the only comment we would see would be the forced published one.
The interpolation comment works well by showing up that variable value.
