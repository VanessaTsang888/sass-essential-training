The @for at-rule
Use to iterate a series of numbers. In JavascripttThis is sometime known as a 
for-loop.

- Count either up or down
- The Format:
    @for <var> to | through <expression> {...}

*/

// Create a list with all of these sizes for the headlines specified as arguments.

$font-size: (3rem, 2.5rem, 2rem);

// Using the at-rule to iterate through a temporary variable which will go through 
// the entire length of the list.
// Then execute the code within the body of this rule. In this case we are using interpolation 
// to return the values or data that is stored in the $i variable.
// Then set the font size by using the value from each of the fields - above arguments passed into the
// $font-size variable.
// So whenever we have a numeric numbers we want to use, the @for at-rule is useful. 
// Its more flexible to use this for-loop
@for $i from 1 through length($font-size) {
  h#{$i} {
    font-size: nth($font-size, $i);
  }
